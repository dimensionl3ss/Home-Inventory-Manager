# Home-Inventory-Manager
How does one calculate the worth of the House Hold goods and equipment's when taking a Household Insurance policy ?
# Overview
In this project, we will build a home inventory manager program. This program lets you keep a
record of your belongings.
A tool control is used to add, delete and save items from the inventory. It is also used to
navigate from one item to the next. The primary way to enter information about an inventory item is
with several text field controls. A combo box is used to specify location, while a date chooser is
used to select purchase date. A check box control indicates if an item is marked with identifying
information. A button control (with an ellipsis) selects a photo to display in the panel control. A
panel control holds 26 buttons for searching.

The program has a built-in sample inventory file – the first item in that file is displayed (items are
listed alphabetically by Inventory Item)
</br>
On the tool control are two buttons marked Previous and Next. Use these to move from one item to the
next. The sample file has 10 items to view. In the Item Search panel are 26 buttons, each with a
letter of the alphabet. These are used to search through the inventory for items beginning with the
clicked letter. Try searching the sample inventory, if you’d like.
Another nice feature of the project is the ability to get a printed record of your inventory. Click the
button marked Print.

A primary task of the home inventory manager is to add, edit, save and delete inventory items. To add
an item, you click the Add button in the toolbar. You then enter the necessary information and click the
Save button. To edit an existing item, you first display the item to edit. Make the desired changes and
click Save. To delete an item, you display the item, then click the Delete button.
